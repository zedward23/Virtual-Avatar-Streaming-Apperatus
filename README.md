## Description
Like many people during the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, I fell down the VTuber rabbit hole and have yet to climb out. Partially I fell in because funny shork go "A", but I was also just personally interested in the tech stack underlying the medium as well as the business implications behind the phenomenon.

This project seeks to act as a free, foundational foray into the task of implementing the entire stack "from scratch" (but with lots of out of box Python packages). I welcome further suggestions and critiques; hopefully I can continue to develop this project to incorporate more of the Live2D aspect of the medium some time in the future.
